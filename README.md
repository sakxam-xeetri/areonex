## 🌍 What is Orlaro?

**Orlaro** is a smart air quality monitoring and automatic air purification system. It continuously measures the tiny invisible particles floating in your air — known as **PM2.5** (particulate matter) — and automatically turns on a fan or air purifier when the air quality drops below safe levels.

### What does it do?

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 📊 **Monitors Air Quality** | Measures PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 particles in real-time |
| 🌐 **Sends Data to Cloud** | Uploads readings to a web dashboard every 10 seconds |
| 🔄 **Automatic Fan Control** | Turns your air purifier ON/OFF based on air quality |
| 📱 **Remote Control** | Control the fan from anywhere via the cloud dashboard |
| 💡 **Visual Status** | LED indicator shows system health at a glance |
| 🔒 **Easy WiFi Setup** | No coding needed — configure WiFi from your phone |

### Why does air quality matter?

- **PM2.5** particles are 30 times smaller than a human hair
- They can enter your lungs and bloodstream
- Long-term exposure causes respiratory and heart problems
- Indoor air can be **2-5 times worse** than outdoor air
- Cooking, candles, dust, and smoke all produce PM2.5

> **Orlaro helps you breathe cleaner air by automatically keeping your purifier running when it's needed most.**

## 🔍 Know Your Device — Parts Explained

### ESP32 Dev Module (The Brain)

This is the main controller. Think of it as a tiny computer that:
- Reads the air quality sensor
- Connects to your WiFi
- Sends data to the internet
- Controls the fan relay
- Shows status via the LED

**Key parts:**
- **USB Port** — For power and programming
- **GPIO Pins** — The numbered holes along the edges (for connecting wires)
- **Built-in LED** — The small light on the board (GPIO2)
- **Reset Button** — Small button labeled "EN" or "RST"

### PMS5003 Sensor (The Nose)

This sensor literally "sniffs" the air. It has a tiny laser and fan inside that:
- Sucks in air through a small opening
- Shines a laser through the air
- Counts particles by detecting laser reflections
- Reports PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations

**Important:** Don't block the air intake holes on the sensor!

### Relay Module (The Switch)

The relay is like a remote-controlled light switch. When the ESP32 sends a signal:
- **Signal ON** → Relay clicks → Your fan/purifier turns ON
- **Signal OFF** → Relay clicks → Your fan/purifier turns OFF

**Important:** The relay can handle mains voltage (AC 220V/110V). If you are connecting mains-powered devices, **have a qualified electrician do the high-voltage wiring**.

### 1.3-inch OLED Display (The Screen)

The OLED screen acts as the primary visual dashboard for your Orlaro device. It provides real-time information without needing to check the cloud or serial monitor:
- Displays current **PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10** particle readings
- Shows **Air Quality Status** (GOOD, MODERATE, POOR) based on standard EPA thresholds
- Indicates the current **Fan/Relay state** and **WiFi connection**
- Displays **setup instructions** and the connection portal IP when disconnected

|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | VCC (Power) | → | **5V** (or VIN) | 🔴 Red |
| 2 | GND (Ground) | → | **GND** | ⚫ Black |
| 3 | TXD (Data Out) | → | **GPIO 16** | 🟢 Green |
| 4 | RXD (Data In) | → | **GPIO 17** | 🟡 Yellow |

> **⚠️ Important:** TXD on the sensor goes to GPIO 16 (RX2) on the ESP32. This is a **cross-connection** — TX to RX. This is correct!

### Relay Module → ESP32

| Wire # | Relay Pin | Connect To | ESP32 Pin | Wire Color (typical) |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| 5 | VCC | → | **5V** (or VIN) | 🔴 Red |
| 6 | GND | → | **GND** | ⚫ Black |
| 7 | IN (Signal) | → | **GPIO 23** | 🔵 Blue |

### OLED Display → ESP32

The OLED uses the I2C protocol, requiring only 4 wires.

| Wire # | OLED Pin | Connect To | ESP32 Pin | Wire Color (typical) |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| 8 | VCC | → | **3.3V** | 🔴 Red |
| 9 | GND | → | **GND** | ⚫ Black |
| 10 | SCL (Clock) | → | **GPIO 22** | 🟡 Yellow |
| 11 | SDA (Data) | → | **GPIO 21** | 🔵 Blue |

### Status LED

Most ESP32 boards have a **built-in LED on GPIO 2**. No extra wiring is needed!

If your board doesn't have one, connect an LED:

| Wire # | LED Part | Connect To | Notes |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 8 | Long leg (+) Anode | → **GPIO 2** | Through a 220Ω resistor |
| 9 | Short leg (-) Cathode | → **GND** | Direct connection |

## 📊 Reading Air Quality Values

### What Are PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10?

These numbers tell you how many tiny particles are in the air:

| Measurement | Particle Size | What Produces It | Why It Matters |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **PM1.0** | Ultra-fine (< 1µm) | Smoke, viruses, combustion | Penetrates deep into lungs |
| **PM2.5** | Fine (< 2.5µm) | Cooking, candles, traffic, fires | Most dangerous — enters bloodstream |
| **PM10** | Coarse (< 10µm) | Dust, pollen, mold | Causes irritation and allergies |

> **µg/m³** = micrograms per cubic meter. This is the standard unit for air quality.

### Air Quality Index — What's Safe?

| PM2.5 Value (µg/m³) | Air Quality | Color | Health Advice |
|---------------------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| 0 – 12 | 🟢 **Good** | Green | Air is clean. No action needed. |
| 13 – 35 | 🟡 **Moderate** | Yellow | Acceptable. Sensitive people may notice effects. |
| 36 – 55 | 🟠 **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups** | Orange | Children, elderly, and asthma patients should limit exposure. |
| 56 – 150 | 🔴 **Unhealthy** | Red | Everyone may experience health effects. Use purifier! |
| 151 – 250 | 🟣 **Very Unhealthy** | Purple | Health alert. Everyone should reduce outdoor activity. |
| 251+ | 🟤 **Hazardous** | Maroon | Emergency conditions. Stay indoors with purifier ON. |

### Where to See the Values

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **OLED Dashboard** | Look directly at the 1.3-inch screen on the device |
| **Serial Monitor** | Connect USB, open Arduino Serial Monitor at 115200 baud |
| **Cloud Dashboard** | Visit the web dashboard (configured by your administrator) |
| **Diagnostics Output** | Printed every 5 seconds on Serial Monitor |

## 🔌 Fan / Purifier Control

### How the Fan is Controlled

The fan (connected through the relay) is controlled by the **cloud server**. Here's how it works:

```
  Cloud Server Decision:
  
  ┌─────────────────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
  │  Server says         │      │  Relay   │      │  Your Fan /  │
  │  fan_on = true   ────│─────▶│  CLICKS  │─────▶│  Purifier    │
  │                      │      │  ON ⚡    │      │  TURNS ON 🌀 │
  └─────────────────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────────┘
  
  ┌─────────────────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
  │  Server says         │      │  Relay   │      │  Your Fan /  │
  │  fan_on = false  ────│─────▶│  CLICKS  │─────▶│  Purifier    │
  │                      │      │  OFF     │      │  TURNS OFF   │
  └─────────────────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────────┘
```

### Control Modes

| Mode | How It Works | Who Controls It |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Auto Mode** | Fan turns ON when PM2.5 exceeds the threshold (e.g., 35 µg/m³) | Server decides automatically |
| **Manual Mode** | You manually turn the fan ON or OFF from the dashboard | You control it remotely |

### Connecting Your Purifier to the Relay

> **⚠️ WARNING: If your air purifier runs on mains power (AC 110V/220V), you MUST have a qualified electrician wire the relay. Incorrect wiring can cause electric shock, fire, or death.**

**For low-voltage fans (5V/12V DC):**

1. Connect the fan's positive wire to the relay's **COM** (Common) terminal
2. Connect the relay's **NO** (Normally Open) terminal to your power supply's positive
3. Connect the fan's negative wire directly to the power supply's negative

**For mains-powered purifiers:**
- Consult a licensed electrician
- The relay acts as a switch in the live/hot wire

### Problem: LED Does a Double-Blink Pattern

**Meaning:** Can't reach the cloud server.

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection (can your phone browse the web?)
2. The server might be temporarily down — wait a few minutes
3. Check if your router's firewall is blocking outgoing HTTPS connections
4. **The device will continue monitoring and controlling the fan with its last known settings** — no data is lost

---

### Problem: Fan Won't Turn On

**Solutions:**
1. Check the relay wiring (IN → GPIO 23, VCC → 5V, GND → GND)
2. Listen for a "click" from the relay — if you hear it, the relay is working but check your fan wiring
3. Make sure the fan/purifier is plugged in and has power
4. Check the cloud dashboard — is `fan_on` set to `true`?
5. Test the relay manually: in the cloud dashboard, set manual mode and turn the fan on

---

### Problem: All Values Show 0

**Solutions:**
1. The sensor needs **30 seconds to warm up** after power-on — wait and check again
2. Check the sensor wiring
3. Make sure air can flow through the sensor (don't block the intake holes)
4. The sensor's internal fan should be spinning — listen for a faint hum

### Problem: Can't Upload the Code

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure you selected **"ESP32 Dev Module"** as the board
2. Select the correct **COM port** under Tools → Port
3. Install the USB driver for your board:
   - **CP2102** chip → Download driver from Silicon Labs
   - **CH340** chip → Download driver from WCH
4. Try a different USB cable (some cables are charge-only and don't carry data)
5. Try holding the **BOOT** button on the ESP32 while uploading

---

### Problem: WiFi Keeps Disconnecting

**Solutions:**
1. Move the device closer to your WiFi router
2. Check the RSSI value in the Serial Monitor (should be better than -70)
3. Make sure the router isn't overloaded with too many devices
4. Try assigning a static IP address to the ESP32 in your router settings
5. Add a WiFi extender near the device

---

### Problem: Device Restarts Randomly

**Solutions:**
1. Use a **quality USB cable** — cheap cables cause voltage drops
2. Use a **5V 2A power adapter** — insufficient power causes brownout resets
3. Don't power the relay and sensor from the ESP32's 3.3V pin — use the **5V/VIN** pin
4. If using a long USB cable, try a shorter one

1. Install **esptool** on your computer:
   ```
   pip install esptool
   ```
2. Find your COM port (check Device Manager on Windows)
3. Run:
   ```
   esptool.py --port COM3 erase_flash
   ```
4. Re-upload the Orlaro firmware
5. The device will start in WiFi setup mode as if brand new

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General

**Q: Does Orlaro work without internet?**  
A: The sensor reads air quality regardless of internet. However, cloud uploading and remote fan control require internet. The fan will maintain its last known state if internet drops.

**Q: Can I use Orlaro outdoors?**  
A: The electronics are not waterproof. For outdoor use, you must place them in a weatherproof enclosure with ventilation for the sensor.

**Q: How accurate is the PMS5003 sensor?**  
A: The PMS5003 has a measurement range of 0-500 µg/m³ with ±10% accuracy for PM2.5. It's accurate enough for home and office use, though not laboratory-grade.

**Q: Does the device store data locally?**  
A: Currently, no. Data is sent directly to the cloud. If the cloud is unavailable, readings are not stored. See [Future Improvements](#future-improvements) for plans to add local buffering.

### WiFi

**Q: Does Orlaro work with 5GHz WiFi?**  
A: **No.** The ESP32 only supports **2.4GHz** WiFi. Most routers broadcast both — make sure you connect to the 2.4GHz network.

**Q: Can I change the WiFi network later?**  
A: Yes! If the device can't connect to the saved network, it will automatically start the `Orlaro_Setup` hotspot. You can also trigger this by erasing the flash (see Emergency Reset).

**Q: What's the WiFi range?**  
A: Same as any WiFi device — typically 10-30 meters indoors depending on walls and interference.

### Sensor

**Q: How often should I clean the sensor?**  
A: Clean the sensor intake with compressed air every 6-12 months, or more often in dusty environments.

**Q: How long does the PMS5003 sensor last?**  
A: The PMS5003 is rated for approximately **8,000 hours** of continuous operation (about 1 year). For longer life, the sensor can be put to sleep periodically (future firmware feature).

**Q: Why do readings fluctuate?**  
A: This is normal. Air quality changes constantly. Readings may spike when cooking, cleaning, or opening windows. The sensor reads every second to provide real-time data.

### Power

**Q: How much power does Orlaro use?**  
A: The full system draws approximately 300-500mA at 5V (1.5-2.5 watts). A standard phone charger (5V, 1A) is sufficient.

**Q: Can I run it on a battery?**  
A: Technically yes, but the continuous WiFi and sensor operation will drain batteries quickly. A 10,000mAh power bank would last approximately 10-15 hours.
